Codebooks

Now that we know what a data file is, we can make more sense out of what a codebook is. A codebook is a technical description of the data that was collected for a particular purpose. It describes how the data are arranged in the computer file or files, what the various numbers and letters mean, and any special instructions on how to use the data properly. Like any other kind of "book," some codebooks are better than others. The best codebooks have:

Description of the study: who did it, why they did it, how they did it.
Sampling information: what was the population studied, how was the sample drawn, what was the response rate.
Technical information about the files themselves: number of observations, record length, number of records per observation, etc.
Structure of the data within the file: hierarchical, multiple cards, etc.
Details about the data: columns in which specific variables can be found, whether they are character or numeric, and if numeric, what format.
Text of the questions and responses: some even have how many people responded a particular way.
