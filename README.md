# Introduction

This material has been prepared to complete the "Data Wrangling Project" assignment as part of the [Springboard Foundations of Data Science Workshop](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science). This project is intended to demonstrate competency in creating a tidy data set from real-world data sources.

## Data Sources

This Data Wrangling Project documents the process used to develop a tidy data set containing the metric used to score sidewalks in [PathWorks](https://github.com/mileserickson/path.works/): specifically, the density of street trees adjacent to each sidewalk segment. The following two data sources were used as inputs:

* [Sidewalks](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/SDOT-Sidewalks/pxgh-b4sz/about) (City of Seattle)
* [Trees in the Public Right of Way](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Trees-in-the-Public-Right-of-Way/tiq5-syif/about) (City of Seattle)

## Data Wrangling & Analysis Process

For more information on the process used to develop the tidy data set, please refer to the [Code Book](https://github.com/mileserickson/springboard_data-wrangling-project/CodeBook.md).
